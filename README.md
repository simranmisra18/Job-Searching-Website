# Job Searching Website

## Problem Statement
The goal to create a “Job Searching Website” which allows the users to act as a job seeker as well as an employer. The job seekers would be able to upload their skills and information into the website and then get job suggestions based on the information entered. They can view and apply to any of their preferrable jobs. The employers on the other and would be able to upload new job availability in the website for the job seekers to view.

## Methodology
-	The selected SDLC model for the project is ‘incremental model’. This is because incremental model is developed in different increments. Each increment progresses through analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment and maintenance in each increment.
-	This model is feasible for this particular software as there might be various changes that need to be implemented after releasing different increments of the project. There might be some additional features to be added based on the Employer and the Job seeker requirements. The phases would not overlap each other. 
-	In the ‘Job searching’ project, the requirements of the user are known and understood. The user requires a platform through which he or she can have direct access to the companies who are willing to hire new employees. The users would submit their resume, their skills, place for job, etc., according to which the website would provide them with suitable job offers in which they could apply. Using this model makes it easier as highest priority and basic requirements can be tackled first and improvements can be introduced in the further increments. It is feasible to append these changes in the upcoming increments.

## Introduction
The proposed title of the project is “Job Searching Website”. Many job seekers are not able to get notifications about job offers and it becomes difficult for them to keep track of all the jobs available according to their developed skills. Moreover, the employers or companies are finding it difficult to provide job availability details without being able to contact the job seekers directly. The entire process has thus become lengthy. The aim is to create a website to provide services that ultimately bring the employer and job seeker closer, thus improving the overall employment status.

### Purpose
#### Users
Those who will primarily benefit from the new system and those who will be affected by the system include:
-	Employers: After implementation, the employers would be able to provide information about the company, skills required, and other necessary details.
-	Job seekers: The website would allow job seekers to login through their username and password. They would be able to update their personal details including resume and skills. They would be provided with the information about the jobs available.
-	Developers: They would be responsible for implementing the database, hosting the website and maintaining the system.

#### Location
The website can be accessed by any customer using the Internet. The developers would be able to access the website and database from any location provided they have the correct platforms.

#### Responsibilities
The primary responsibilities of the website are as follows:
-	Allow employers to login using username and password.
-	Provide the employers with a platform to put up information about the job.
-	Allow employers to specify the skills required.
-	Allow job seekers to login using correct username and password.
-	Allow job seekers to submit personal information to the employer/company along with resume.
-	Allow the job seekers to mention their skills and qualifications.
-	Provide the job seeker with the details of the available jobs.
-	Allow job seekers to apply for the job.

Other desired features of the website are as follows:
-	A consistent look and feel throughout the website.
-	Easy navigation through the various webpages.
-	Easily understandable to the user.
-	Organized website content.

#### Need
This website is needed in order to service the increasing amount of job seekers looking for jobs based on their skills. This website would satisfy the needs of both the employers and the job seekers and would save much time.

### Motivation
It is often seen that many job seekers are not able to have access to the job availability details even though they have enough skills and qualifications for the job. This has led to the problem of unemployment. The present day organization work can be classified into two forms, one is the manual system and the other one is the integrated computerized system. In manual system, all work is done manually on paper. Lots of paper work is being done in order to enter new connection records. The data which manual systems have in common has to be provided separately to different departments resulting in lots of inter departmental paper work and also simultaneous updating of records is almost impossible.  Developing a website that would provide information about the jobs available would allow the job seekers and employers/companies to interact with each other faster and more efficiently.

### Significance
The Job Searching Website will minimize the inter departmental paper work. Afterwards it is only a process of manipulation and consolidation to convert it to any form desired by the users. This website would provide services that ultimately bring the employer and job seeker closer, thus improving the overall employment status in much lesser time and the process becomes much easier.

### Scope
The scope of this project is a web-based system that would manage Job seekers, keeping track of their progress and performance across all types of training activities by contrast, and manages content or objects that are served up to the right person at the right time.   

## General Description
This section should describe the general factors that affect the product and its requirements.  This section makes the requirements easier to understand.

### Beneficiaries
-	The job seekers would easily be able to have access to the jobs available and their details based on their skills.
-	The companies/employees provide information of the jobs available on the website.
-	There is a direct communication between the job seekers and the employers.
-	The entire system is faster and more efficient.
-	It saves a lot of effort because of reducing the manual work done.

### General Limitations
Many tools and techniques have been used to develop the software according to their requirements. It is not a complete project without its limitations. There are few limitations of the project which are described below.

#### User’s Point of View
-	There is no provision to make online live communication/ interview.

#### Programmer’s Point of View
-	No strong database has been used. So, the data stored is not encoded.
-	An older version of Visual Basic IDE is used. So many of the new features provided by the new versions are not included in the program.
-	User’s interactions could not be seen on the software such as how many times the subscriber has visited the website.
- Subscriber who has forgotten his/her password cannot be regenerated. There is no provision for password hints. He/she will have to create his/her login id again.

### Constraints 
These are the requirements that are not directly related to the functionality of the system. These should be considered as mandatory when the system is developed. The following constraints were arrived at for the system:

-	For gaining entry into the system, the users should be registered and should be able use login & passwords for gaining access to the system.
-	The users should be able to change their passwords for increased security.
- The system should be easy to understand and organized in a structured way. The users should also receive feedback about any errors that occur.
-	There should be no limitation about the hardware platform that is to be used to run the system. 
-	Data integrity should be maintained if an error occurs or the whole system comes down.
